,                   she is a really good prof but she really makes you work for your grade the lectures and readings are a must because the tests are difficult the assignment will boost your mark but it was a very boring assignment interesting lecture material and she encourages class participation with top hat                  
,                   really cares about her students and enjoys getting feedback emphasizes too much on studies and not enough on general concepts midterms were hard and she speaks too quickly in lectures really organized slides but always runs out of time going through the slides lots of readings and book review rubric was difficult to understand                
,                   im not a psych major so i often found a lot of her concepts a bit over my head her tests are tough and are a mix of short answer and multiple choice you need to read all the materials and there are a lot in order to do well she really knows her stuff though and cares a lot about her students input if you love psych youll love her                
,                   she seems like such a great person who genuinely cares for her students her lectures are very organized and clear                 
,                   interesting and enthusiastic prof she definitely wants to make sure her students understand the material however she often presents confusing studies and goes through lectures too quickly i found the midterms challenging as the questions were quite wordy but still did relatively well overall a good prof though attend class and read the text                
,                   dr bergseiker is a really great professor and is very clearly motivated to help her students succeed its pretty easy to get a high mark if you attend class and do the reading the questions are clear and concrete                
,                   great prof super enthusiastic about the material makes the lectures interesting to attend and just a really nice person her tests are fair and pretty easy just read the book and attend lectures and you should get 80s90s                
,                   she was awesome i was a little scared after the first exam the class average was not very high but all you need to do is get used to her exam style and then you will do okay she is very generous and helpful she focuses alot on studies and their results                
,                   there were 2 midterms a book reviewquiz and a final exam in the course the professor seemed very interesting and smart however i thought that she tried to cover too much content in her slides  as she kept running out of time cutting down on studies would help book review expectations should have also been clearer overall great professor                
,                   absolutely fantastic prof really passionate about the subject social psych but also about teaching in general cares a lot about her students she communicated with us and asked our opinion much more than any other prof ive had and like someone else said shes worked in person with some of the top people in the field so she knows her stuff                
,                   i was so impressed with h bergsieker from day one  she received her education at stanford and princeton  awesome  she had philip zimbardo for a psych 101 prof  she is organized and very concerned that students understand the concepts she teaches  take this class with her  i loved it  this was my favourite psych class at uw                
,                   prof bergsieker is one of the more amazing profs i have ever had she is a very down to earth person and truly cares about her students if you read the textbook and pay attention to the studies discussed in class you will do very well in the class she is very fair with her midterms and wants everyone to do well highly recommend                
,                   best psych prof ive had at waterloo so far she presents the information in a really interesting way and is a very fair marker if you go to class and pay attention youll do well on the tests  i definitely recommend her                
,                   bergsieker killed social pyschology for me i became very bored with her format of presenting study after study her exams are also difficult try to remember everything she taught or else you wont do well on her exams                
,                   hands down one of the most helpful professors ive had she does everything she can to help her students succeed and you can tell shes really passionate about what she does she also shows alot of interesting videos in class and im never bored                
,                   i am not a psych major but she made this social psych course very enjoyable she wants her students to succeed and does everything that she can to help though reading the textbook and attending lecture are highly recommended definitely recommend her                
,                   keeps her lectures interesting and relevant does everything she can to help students succeed                
,                   one of my favorite profs at uw his lectures are a lot of fun and very easy to sit through he gives you the material that you need and goes on interesting tangents about history during his lectures the lectures arent necessary to do your best but they really are fun and you dont have to figure out the pitfalls on your own                
,                   great at explaining the new grammar etc of the language always has a funny side story to tell about roman culture word origins or even his daily life approachable and helpful though you may need to draw more attention to yourself then raising your hand third declension third conjugation changes the game so be ready for when those come                
,                   such a nice guy so funny makes classes are interesting you can tell hes really passionate about what hes teaching                 
,                   you dont usually expect latin profs to be so funny                
,                   he is an amazing prof he is very funny and engaging and his lectures were very entertaining you can tell by his enthusiasm that he genuinely enjoys and loves what hes teaching and thats a great quality that many profs lack if you have the chance definitely take this class with him im even taking latin next year just to have him again                 
,                   put in the work and youll pass and have a great laugh during lectures                
,                   awesome prof awesome class definitely the best course that i have taken so far will probably remain the best i wish i could more classes with him                 
,                   had him at wlu for a roman civ class and he is overall a good prof but falls off track a lot if you want to pass the course with a decent grade you need to really be able to grasp a lot of content because he covers 16 chapters in 11 weeks                 
,                   hes an amazing lecturer who really knows how to keep things interesting most tests and quizzes were noncumulative and all of them were straightforward one of the best classes ive ever taken                 
,                   hes a really funny prof that keeps lectures as interesting as possible there are moments where he talks too fast or trails off but he realizes this and cracks a joke about it hes very helpful if you needask anything this is the only class i have never skipped because i actually enjoylearn when i attend                
,                   the midterms and final are all multiple choice there are pictures that you need to recognize on the final the midterms cover 90 of lecture material and 10 textbook material attending lecture is a must the slides provide almost no information i find it hard to spell the names the prof says he speaks a bit fast and you have to take notes fast                
,                   first 23 lectures are super boring you kinda need the textbook for some of the questions or you can wikipedia the characters if you take notes in class hes fun and a good prof but he tells the stories by jumping back and forth repeatedly which gets confusing and slightly uninteresting still a fun course and a good prof tho                
,                   he is definitely an interesting prof i like his tangents it makes lessons memorable received a grade of 92 with 12hr cramming for quizzes and 5hr studying for final he provides outlines of what is tested so nothing should be difficult very straightforward class guaranteed 80 if you give 1hr studying a week                
,                   this course is a breeze if you go to class just write down everything he says because the tests are based on that he would also tell you what sections to read in the textbook too super helpful and an easy going guy if youre into mythology i recommend you take this course                
,                   by far the best prof i had you dont have to use the textbook but to get above an 80 you should even if the readings are long they are very intriguing just like a bedtime story if you read the textbook you are capable of 90                
,                   very funny teacher multiple choice tests are so easy if you can really remember names and details attending class is a must the textbook can be hard to understand and most of the test questions are from class                
,                   best teachertake him if you can                
,                   really funny  made the lectures enjoyable and entertaining  so much better than reading the textbook                
,                   excellent professor very funny and interesting                
,                   great prof one of my favorites this term really funny and keeps you interested during lectures gives faireasy midterms and final would definitely recommend taking clas 104 with him                
,                   he is an extremely good professor who completely understands what hes talking about and knows how to word it so its easy to understand he answers class questions very well and has a good sense of humor if you can get him as your prof then do it                
,                   great lectures in class if you skip his lectures you are missing out he is invited to many crypto conferences world wide and not surprisingly so he teaches with clarity and overall i think this makes him a great speaker and lecturer                
,                   although the class he taught me was boring easy at least he made it clear                
,                   very knowledgable and comprehensive in his teaching when you paid attention and understood the material prior to the beginning of the class you were fine  however it was very easy to tell that he taught to the upper end of the class and left the middle and lower ends to struggle                
,                   absolutely superb prof explains everything extremely well with a good attitude and answers all question while still keeping a good pace perhaps the best cs135 teacher you can get                
,                   awesome prof teaches ideas and concepts rather than minimum curriculum so enthusiastic for cs and prepares you for exams very well very timeconsuming assignments for all sections though some background required overall makes me wish i was majoring in cs                
,                   professor goldberg is awesome hes a brainiaccypherpunkwizard very enthusiastic about cs his lectures introducing functional programming picqued my interest and assignments and exams were fun and fair i hope i can take another course with him in my upper years                
,                   easily the best cs prof i have ever had at waterloo im in 4b lectures are extremely clear and he makes the material really interesting on top of that he is fair in marking but not too hard                
,                   make me be interesting in cs and explain the class very clear                
,                   nice painted toenails                
,                   entertaining keeps you interested great explanations and examples                
,                   entertaining guy kinda weird sometimesknows his stuff though has a wikipedia page if youre interested                
,                   he thinks he knows it all  i am not sure why uw hired him because he couldnt teach people who are not smart                
,                   one of the best professors ive had so far he explains everything clearly does excellent examples in class even shows it in drscheme                
,                                   
,                   not the best prof but good enough that you can understand whats going on if youre paying attention it might get hard to do this a little too fast sometimes though                
,                   this guy should teach only smart students because he does not know how to teach otherwise
